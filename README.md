# Beckhoff-Examples
## Modern features in not so modern environment.

This repository contains simple features like : 

- Sending a text message 
- Sedning an email
- Sorting an array
- Making a REST API call
- Data persistance to a database
- Generated user interface

**BUT** with a PLC. PLC is an idustrial Arduino on steroids.

Unfortunatelly working with PLC is cumbersome. 

PLCs were meant to replace physical wiring of relay logic - so it's more electrical engineering than software engineering.

So obviously it's not really good at software stuff

...unfortunatelly the industry forces you to write enterprise software in a PLC.

Beckhoff's TwinCAT 3 is one of few which offers modern features like object oriented programming, open API and integration in Visual Studio. 
Other platforms are using their own IDE with their own language.
